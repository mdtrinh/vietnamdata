\title{vietnamdata: Data and Empirical Tools for Quantitative Political
Science Research on Vietnam}
\description{
The \code{vietnamdata} package provides several datasets that are useful for
political scientists interested in Vietnam, and convenient functions for
empirical analysis using these datasets
}
\details{
The package contains four key datasets: planned national budget breakdowns by
provinces, realized national budget breakdowns by provinces, Provincial
Competitiveness Index (PCI) aggregate and component scores by provinces, and
Public Administration Performance Index (PAPI) aggregate and component scores
by provinces.

It also provides convenient functions to perform Randomization Inference
implementation for some common empirical methods such as Linear Regression,
Weighted Fixed Effects Regression, and Synthetic Control. These functions are
often helpful for finite-sample problems that often characterize
provincial-level quantitative analyses of Vietnam.
}
\section{Datasets}{

\itemize{

  \item \code{VNbudget_plan} is a data frame containing planned national
  budget broken down by provinces for all Vietnamese provinces from 2006 to
  2016. Planned budgets are issued at the beginning of every year. It
  contains 46 variables, which include province and year IDs, total revenues,
  total expenditures, central transfers broken down by categories, as well as
  log transformations, lags and change values for the latter.

  \item \code{VNbudget_final} is a data frame containing realized national
  budget broken down by provinces for all Vietnamese provinces from 2006 to
  2014. Realized budgets are calculated at the end of every year. It contains
  38 variables, which include province and year IDs, total revenues, total
  expenditures, central transfers broken down by categories, as well as log
  transformations, lags and change values for the latter.

  \item \code{pci} is a data frame containing results from the Provincial
  Competitiveness Index (PCI) survey, aggregated at the province level for
  all Vietnamese provinces from 2005 to 2016. It contains 15 variables, which
  include province and year IDs, weighted and unweighted aggregate PCI
  scores, and component PCI scores.

  \item \code{papi} is a data frame containing results from the Public
  Administration Performance Index (PAPI) survey, aggregated at the province
  level for all Vietnamese provinces from 2005 to 2016. It contains 15
  variables, which include province and year IDs, weighted and unweighted
  aggregate PAPI scores, and component PAPI scores.
}
}

\section{Empirical tools}{

\itemize{

  \item \code{rireg} performs Randomization Inference for Ordinary Least Squares regressions

  \item \code{riwfe} performs Randomization Inference for Weighted Fixed Effects regressions

  \item \code{riSynth} performs Randomization Inference for the Synthetic Control method,
  with option for parallel computation

  \item \code{plot.riFit} and \code{plot.riSynth} produces simple visualization for results
  from \code{rireg}, \code{riwfe}, and \code{riSynth}

  \item \code{genperms} produces permutation matrices for an arbitrary vector with options for
  block and clustered randomization. Can permute non-binary vectors
}
}

\section{Note}{

  The functions in this package makes heavy use of existing functions from
  the \code{wfe}, \code{Synth}, and \code{permute} packages. All errors in
  implementation, howerver, are my own.
